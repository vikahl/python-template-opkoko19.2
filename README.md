# Python project template

Template for Python projects, based on Cookiecutter

The purpose of this project is to serve as an example of a creating projects from templates in my presentation
  _Modern Python development_ at Omegapoints conference OpKoKo 19.2.

It aims to be an example and to be consistent with the [todo_extractor](https://github.com/vikahl/todo-extractor/)
 and is thus probably not suitable to use as a basis for generic Python projects. However, if the template is
 useful, please go ahead and create awesome Python projects with it!

## Usage

After installing cookiecutter (preferably with [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx)), create a new project
 by running:

```shell
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/vikahl/python-template.git
```
